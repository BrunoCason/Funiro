# Project Description
Funiro is a project to develop a website for a fictional furniture store, built using React. The main goal is to faithfully recreate the original design of the mentioned pages, following the model established in Figma, providing an intuitive and pleasant user experience. Additionally, the project includes several advanced features, such as user authentication using Firebase, individual pages for each product, carousel image display on the homepage, integration of a shopping cart with Redux, among others.

# Project Features

- `User Authentication`: Uses Firebase for authentication, ensuring secure and personalized access for users on the website.
- `Furniture Catalog`: Displays all available furniture for sale, organized by categories with detailed information on each product.
- `Product Details`: Detailed view of each furniture item when clicked, redirecting to a specific page with information such as description, price, and sizes.
- `Carousel Image Display`: Uses libraries like Splide to display images of the furniture in a carousel on the homepage, providing a dynamic visual experience.
- `Shopping Cart Integration`: Implements Redux to manage the global state of the shopping cart, allowing efficient addition, removal, and updating of items.
- `Pagination and Filters`: Implements pagination and search filters on the furniture catalog page, improving the user's navigation experience.
- `Contact Form`: Provides a form with validation of all fields using the Zod library.
- `Responsiveness`: Ensures the website is fully responsive, adapting appropriately to mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
- `Product API`: Uses a RESTful API to manage and provide the furniture data, ensuring integrity and security in data handling.
- `Images`: All images used in the project are stored on AWS S3 to ensure proper availability and performance.
